## shinyapps.io

This is first in planned series of blogs usually related to apps I develop for the [mytinyshinys site](https://mytinyshinys.shinyapps.io/dashboard/) focusing on analysing meta data. 
Commented out code can be shown or hidden by toggling buttons


For those of you distributing shiny apps using  [RStudio shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/), the [rsconnect](https://github.com/rstudio/rsconnect) package provides some metrics on package use

I have developed a small app for users to check their own information by inputting their account name and then any of their apps via input boxes. The full code can be viewed on [github](https://github.com/pssguy/shinyAppsAnalytics)

```{r table, echo=TRUE}

# # creative a reactive 
# data <- eventReactive (input$go,{
#   
#   req(input$account)
#   
#   # this is key function with a split of the datetime field returned
#   apps <- applications(input$account) %>% 
#        mutate(created=str_sub(created_time,1,10),last_active=str_sub(updated_time,1,10))
#   
#   apps$name <- as.character(apps$name)
#   apps$status <- as.character(apps$status)
#   
#  
#   choices <- sort(apps$name)
#   
#   info=list(apps=apps,choices=choices)
#   return(info)
# 
# })  
#  # render a datatable with selected fields 
#   output$appsTable <- DT::renderDataTable({
#  
#   
# data()$apps %>%
#     select(name,status,created,last_active) %>% 
#      arrange(desc(last_active)) %>%  
#   DT::datatable(class='compact stripe hover row-border order-column',rownames=FALSE,options= list(paging = TRUE, searching = TRUE,info=FALSE))
# })


```

This produces a table with apps listed with info on whether they are running and when created and last used

You can then select a package to view active hours by day - currently just over preceding month

```{r tabsets, echo=TRUE}
# appData <- eventReactive (input$getChart,{
#   
#   req(input$app)
#   req(input$account)
#   
#   # key function - there are some variables which i may include in future release
#   appInfo <- showUsage(appDir = getwd(), appName = input$app, account = input$account,
#                                 server = NULL, usageType = "hours", from = NULL, until = NULL,
#                                 interval = NULL)
#   
#   
#   
#   appInfo$time <- as.POSIXct(appInfo$timestamp, origin="1970-01-01")
#   
# 
#   
#   ## the data returned often has 2 values for an hour - one of which is zero
#   appInfo <-appInfo %>% 
#     arrange(time) %>% 
#     filter(hours!=0.00) %>% 
#     mutate(date=as.Date(str_sub(time,1,10)),hr=as.integer(str_sub(time,12,13)))
#   
# })
# 
# output$appChart <- renderPlotly({
#   
#   
#   # Need to account for days where there are zero active hours
#   start <- min(appData()$date) 
#   end <- max(appData()$date)
#   allDates <- data.frame(date=seq(start, end, by = "days"))
#   
#  
#   appData() %>% 
#     group_by(date) %>% 
#     summarize(totTime=sum(hours)) %>% 
#     right_join(allDates) %>% 
#     mutate(hrs=ifelse(is.na(totTime),0,totTime)) %>% 
#     plot_ly(x=date,y=hrs,markers="lines")%>% 
#       layout(hovermode = "closest",
#              xaxis=list(title=" "),
#              yaxis=list(title="Hours per Day")
#       )
#   
# })
```


A simple graph is produced. I tend to use plotly by default - so you can hover over to get precise figures
when run

With the shiny package loaded, run ` runGitHub("shinyAppsAnalytics", "pssguy")` in your console

As mentioned above, all the code is on a [github repo](https://github.com/pssguy/shinyAppsAnalytics) so you can enhance and extend as required
